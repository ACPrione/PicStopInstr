This is an "AutoIT3" script to run the Picarro "Stop Instrument" command and
automatically select the "Stop software and driver" option, and then 
automatically click OK's.

This was written to be used with the Priority1 GUI to provide a single command
that would cause the instrument to stop, but the computer to continue running.

It can be run as a script if AutoIT3 is installed, but can also be compiled 
into a standa alone executable. 

For Priority1, the standalone executable should be stored in
c:\cygwin64\home\picarro\bin and the shortcut file should be copied
to the desktop.
